## Recap

I used React, Redux and Sass. I was not able to get the chart working the way I had wanted to with the data via Redux so I used a placeholder image.  

For the table I used my own styling to space the columns 5 x 20%. I later found out there was a library that I could've used to implement a table built in with sorting. To implement the dollar sign to the numbers I used JavaScript's built in padStart. I was only able to target 6 digit numbers in the time frame. For numbers below 6 an extra dollar sign was added. I am sure I could make a custom function to account for the length of each number e.g. 4, 5, converted to string. 

My styling choices came down to Sass and Styled Components. I'm comfortable with both but I chose Sass because there's less complexity on the component structure and I could import just one stylesheet versus x amount of components.

All in all, that was engaging and I know how I could improve this moving forward. Thanks.
